graphicsmagick (1.3.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 1.3.12.
    + Fixes writing to standard output. Closes: #571719
  * magick/effect.c: Disable OpenMP threading on Sparc for MedianFilterImage()
    and ReduceNoiseImage() as it seems to cause eccessively long runtimes.
    Should prevent build failures due to the testsuite timing out on the
    Sparc buildds. Advice from upstream.

graphicsmagick (1.3.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libgraphicsmagick++3.symbols*: Maintaining symbols files
    for a C++ ABI does not appear to be a good idea at present as
    arch- and optimisation-dependent symbols from instantiated standard
    templates tend to slip in. Turn off generation of symbols files
    for the C++ bindings, but keep respective files with suffix
    ".disabled" for potential later re-use. As a side-effect, this
    change also fixes the build failures on i386 and armel.
    Closes: #522706
  * debian/control: graphicsmagick-dbg has been moved to section debug.
    Adapt control file accordingly.

graphicsmagick (1.1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First upload to official Debian archives. Closes: #345017
  * New upstream version.
  * debian/*: Major overhaul to comply with packaging standards. Apart
    from the changelog, few lines have survived the clean-up. Still, we
    try to ensure smooth upgrade from the previous, unofficial packages.
    Most notable packaging changes:
    + Names of library packages are properly versioned.
    + Name of compatibility package expanded to -imagemagick-compat.
    + Removed compatibility shell script, and replaced with simple
      symlinks to gm. Extra functionality from wrapper was only required
      by old versions of typo3 according to previous maintainers.
    + New compatibility package -libmagick-dev-compat providing wrappers
      for package development.
    + Build separate packages for C++ library.
    + Drop separate -doc package.
    + More verbose package descriptions.
    + Run test suite at build time.
    + Disable support for obsolete libdps. Build-depend on ghostscript
      instead for ps/pdf regression tests.
    + New maintainer.
  * PerlMagick/t/ttf/read.t: Disabled ttf testcase that is known to fail
    because of problems with special characters.
  * magick/{blob.c,command.c,image.c,log.c,utility.c,utility.h}:
    FormatString() was called with unsanitized user input. Introduced
    new helper function FormatStringNumeric() to allow a single numeric
    format expansion. (This is a more complete fix for CAN-2005-0397
    reported against ImageMagick.)
  * magick/attribute.c: Apply missing piece of fix for heap overflow in
    EXIF parser from ImageMagick patch. (CAN-2004-0981)
  * configure.ac, configure: Fix typo that lead to an undefined delegate
    for HTML conversion.
  * magick/constitute.c: Apply upstream fix for potential NULL pointer
    dereference in ReadImage().
  * magick/{delegate.c,symbols.h,tempfile.h,tempfile.c}: When calling
    external delegates, check filename against whitelist of safe
    characters, and pass securely named symlink to delegate if check fails.
